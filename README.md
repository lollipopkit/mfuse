MFuse is a macOS app that exposes remote storage in Finder through File Provider, with a modular backend layer for multiple protocols.

## What MFuse Is

MFuse combines a macOS app, a File Provider extension, and a set of protocol-specific Swift packages into one remote filesystem client.

The app manages connection definitions, credentials, and user actions. The File Provider extension bridges those connections into Finder-visible domains. Each remote protocol is implemented as an independent backend package behind a shared virtual filesystem interface.

## Supported Backends

- SFTP
- S3
- WebDAV
- SMB
- FTP
- NFS
- Google Drive

## How It Works

MFuse is split into three main layers:

- `MFuse/`: the macOS SwiftUI app for managing connections and user workflows.
- `MFuseProvider/`: the File Provider extension that exposes remote content to Finder.
- `Packages/`: reusable Swift packages, including `MFuseCore` plus protocol backends such as `MFuseSFTP`, `MFuseS3`, and `MFuseWebDAV`.

Shared connection metadata is stored through `SharedStorage`, while secrets are handled by `KeychainService`. Mounting is handled through `FileProviderMountProvider`, and mounted domains become visible through macOS File Provider.
Mounted domains are persistent across app relaunches as long as the connection config still exists. MFuse also recreates a convenience shortcut for active mounts in a writable shortcuts directory. A manual disconnect removes both the File Provider domain and the shortcut, so it will not be restored automatically on the next launch.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- macOS 14+
- Xcode 15+
- Swift 5.9+
- [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen)
- `swiftlint` for linting

### Generate the Xcode project

```bash
make generate
```

### Run tests

```bash
make test
```

`make test` currently maps to `test-stable` and runs the stable local package subset.
Use `make test-all` when you want the full package test matrix.

### Lint

```bash
make lint
```

### Build

```bash
make build
```

### Local Xcode builds

If you build `MFuse.app` from Xcode and copy it into `/Applications`, use a valid Apple development team for both the app target and the File Provider extension target.

Unsigned or ad hoc signed builds can still launch, but macOS may ignore the File Provider extension because the App Group entitlement is not accepted at runtime. When that happens, mounts fail and Finder may show missing-file errors for the generated convenience shortcut.

## Common Commands

```bash
make generate   # regenerate MFuse.xcodeproj from project.yml
make test       # run the stable package test subset (alias of test-stable)
make test-all   # run the full package test matrix
make lint       # run SwiftLint
make build      # build the app scheme
make clean      # remove build outputs
```

## Local Release DMG

The repository includes local release scripts for building a signed, notarized `DMG` on your Mac:

- `scripts/release/install-apple-signing.sh`
- `scripts/release/cleanup-apple-signing.sh`
- `scripts/release/build-and-notarize-dmg.sh`
- `scripts/release/release-dmg.sh`

Required local inputs:

- `APPLE_DEVELOPER_ID_APP_P12_PATH`
- `APPLE_DEVELOPER_ID_APP_P12_PASSWORD`
- `APPLE_DEVELOPER_ID_APP_PROFILE_PATH`
- `APPLE_DEVELOPER_ID_EXTENSION_PROFILE_PATH`
- `APPLE_TEAM_ID`
- `APPLE_NOTARY_KEY_ID`
- `APPLE_NOTARY_ISSUER_ID`
- `APPLE_NOTARY_API_KEY_PATH`

The scripts load `.env` from the repository root by default. Environment variables exported in the shell still take precedence. A starter template is provided at `.env.release.example`.

Typical flow:

- install the Developer ID Application certificate and two provisioning profiles into a temporary local keychain
- regenerate `MFuse.xcodeproj` from `project.yml`
- archive and export a `Release` build with `developer-id` signing
- build and sign a `DMG`
- notarize the `DMG` with `notarytool` and staple the ticket
- restore the previous default keychain and remove temporary signing assets automatically

Example:

```bash
cp .env.release.example .env
# edit .env

make generate
make release-dmg
```

`make release-dmg` now performs install, build, notarization, and cleanup in one run. If you need manual control, use `make release-install-signing` and `make release-clean-signing`.

`PKG` is intentionally not included here. It requires a separate `Developer ID Installer` certificate.

## Testing

Current test coverage is centered on Swift packages, especially:

- `MFuseCore` core models and connection management
- `MFuseFTP` parser behavior
- `MFuseWebDAV` XML parsing

Some backend tests are placeholders or integration-oriented, so protocol coverage is not uniform yet.
